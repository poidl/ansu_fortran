### ansu_fortran

A Fortran program for calculating approximately neutral surfaces in the ocean. 

This program transforms a single poorly adjusted surface (such as a 
potential density surface of global extent) into an 
approximately neutral surface with minimal error during a number of iterations.

#### DIRECTORY STRUCTURE AND BUILD

- `ansu.f90`  
   Fortran module providing the subroutine `optimize_surface()`. Depends on the 
   GSW Oceanographic Toolbox and the LSQR algorithm (see below). To build the module, edit the 
   Makefile to point to the dependencies, and type

	`make ansu.o`
	
- `run.f90`  
   An executable program that illustrates the use of `optimize_surface()`. Additionaly
   to the GSW Toolbox and LSQR, the NetCDF library must be available to read/write data. The input
   data set (10 MB) can be downloaded from [http://www.hoitaus.com/drupal/files/data/os_input.nc]
   To build the executable, edit the Makefile to point to the dependencies, and type

	`make run`

- `user_input.nml`  
   Contains some parameters that can be changed without re-compiling.

- `definitions.f90`  
   Some global definitions

- `ncutils.f90`  
   NetCDF input/output

- `third_party`  
   Contains the LSQR library.




#### DEPENDENCIES

ansu.f90 depends on two third-party libraries.

- Gibbs-SeaWater (GSW) Oceanographic Toolbox (Fortran library)
   This library is not distributed with ansu. It is available at
   [http://www.teos-10.org/software.htm]

- LSQR: Sparse Equations and Least Squares
   Provided by Systems Optimization Laboratory, Stanford 
   University the terms of the OSI Common Public License (CPL)
   Reference: C. C. Paige and M. A. Saunders, LSQR: An algorithm for sparse
   linear equations and sparse least squares, TOMS 8(1), 43-71 (1982). 
   This library is distributed with ansu.


run.f90 additionally requires the NetCDF (Fortran) library

- NetCDF 
   Available from [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/].



#### FURTHER DOCUMENTATION
